<h1>Activities</h1>
<p>I have a strong passion for gaming which is what led me to choosing this course as later I would like to go into games development and make my way up to become a Senior Games Developer at a prestigious company like Rockstar Games. I also love football and love playing 5v5 football with friends. My love of football is also what got me into gaming through a game called FIFA and really ignited my passion.</p>
